# Tesla Space Project
This is the capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate by Coursera

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage, crucial for cost-effective SpaceX launches. By determining the landing outcome, we estimate launch costs, as SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, significantly less than competitors due to first stage reusability. Our model aims to aid optimizatioin of launch operations and cost projections.

## Project Structure
